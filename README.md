Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python.  
The goal is to clean the data, create basic visualizations, and extract simple insights.

Steps Performed
- Loaded the Titanic dataset from Seaborn.  
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates.  
- Created visualizations:  
  - Bar chart of passenger gender distribution.  
  - Histogram of passenger ages.  
  - Correlation heatmap.  

Key Insights
- More male passengers than female.  
- Most passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.  
- Higher fare showed a positive correlation with survival.  

How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook `titanic-eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis  

## ðŸ“Ž Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
